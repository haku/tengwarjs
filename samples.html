        <p>The doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Say: 'friend', and Enter: <span class="tengwar">Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: pedo mellon a minno.</span></p>

        <p>Gandalf: <span class="tengwar">Gandalf</span>. Interesting because
        of the "nd" cluster.</p>
        
        <p>Isildur: <span class="tengwar">Isildur</span>.  Interesting
        because it is necessary for the silme to become silme-nuquerna for
        the I diacritic to fit above.  There is an alternative
        short-carrier with an S-hook that could be used, but I've elected
        to keep this simple. Also interesting because the final-R must be
        "ore" instead of "romen".  "alda" is not used for the "ld" cluster
        because in this mode, that is reserved for "lh".</p>

        <p>Baranduiniant: <span class="tengwar">Baranduiniant</span></p>

        <p>Amon Sûl: <span class="tengwar">Amon Sûl</span>. The û must be
        treated as ú.  The ú must come from the extended font and still have
        zero width.</p>

        <p>Aragorn: <span class="tengwar">Aragorn Arathorn: Telcontar,
        Elessar</span>. Double-S all the way.</p>

        <p>Mellon: <span class="tengwar">Mellon</span>. Interesting for
        use of double-L.</p>

        <p>Glorfindel: <span class="tengwar">Glorfindel</span></p>

        <p>Gwathló: <span class="tengwar">Gwathló</span>. Interesting because
        of the following-W diacritic.</p>

        <p>Galadriel: <span class="tengwar">Galadriel</span>. Interesting
        because medial-R must be "romen", not "ore".</p>

        <p>Aty: <span class="tengwar">Aty</span>.  Not a word. Interesting
        because of the combination of "y" below and "a" above.</p>

        <p>Mordor: <span class="tengwar">Mordor</span>. Includes both medial
        and final R by way of "romen" and "ore".  Also showcases the "rd"
        cluster with "arda".</p>

        <p>Hwesta Sindarinwa: <span class="tengwar">Hwesta Sindarinwa</span>.
        Interesting because of use of tengwa "vala" medially in "sindarinwa"
        because the vowel slot is taken by preceeding-I on "numen". Also
        interesting because of use of "hwesta-sindarinwa", subsuming the "w" as
        a voiceless-labial-fricative.</p>

        <p>Ainur: <span class="tengwar">Ainur</span>. Interesting because of
        the "ai" diphthong.</p>

        <p>Mae Govannen: <span class="tengwar">Mae Govannen</span>. Interesting
        because of the "ae" diphthong and the prenasal tilde above "numen" for
        the double-N.  This could be done with a tilde beneath as well.</p>

        <p>Helcaraxë: <span class="tengwar">Helcaraxë</span>. Not Sindarin, but
        Quenya in the Sindarin mode. Interesting because the "x" must be
        converted to a "cs" or "ks" cluster and that there is a following-S
        diacritic for "calma".  The diaresis on the E must be ignored.</p>

        <p>Lhûn: <span class="tengwar">Lhûn</span>.  Debatable since "alda"
        might be used for aspirated-L or for the "ld" cluster in General
        Use.<p>

        <p>Hyarmen: <span class="tengwar">Hyarmen</span>.  Interesting because
        of following-Y and the use of the eponymous first tengwa.</p>

        <p>Dagor Bragolach <span class="tengwar">Dagor Bragolach</span>.
        Interesting because of use of "hwesta" for
        voiceless-palatal-fricative.</p>

        <p>Galadhrim: <span class="tengwar">Galadhrim</span>. Interesting
        because of "dh" cluster.</p>

        <p>Rhûn: <span class="tengwar">Rhûn</span>. Interesting because of
        voiceless-R, represented by "arda".</p>

        <p>Noldor: <span class="tengwar">Noldor</span>. Interesting
        because there must be an explicit exception to distinguish
        initial-N pronounced "ng" from initial-N pronounced N.</p>

        <p>Ñoldor: <span class="tengwar">Ñoldor</span>. Explicit use of
        "ungwe".</p>

        <p>Nwalme: <span class="tengwar">Nwalme</span>. Interesting because
        following-W implies that the N represent Ñ.</p>

        <p>Iaur: <span class="tengwar">Iaur</span>. In "iaur", the initial-I is
        consonantal, represented by "yanta". This is a very special case and
        distinct from the typical initial-I as in "isildur", but not distinct
        from "iant" (bridge).</p>

        <p>Iant: <span class="tengwar">Iant</span>. Consonantal initial-I
        represented by "yanta".</p>

        <p>Moria: <span class="tengwar">Moria</span>.  Important that the "ia" not be combined into a diphthong.</p>

        <p>Is: <span class="tengwar">Is</span>. This S-hook appears in no other case and is included here just to show you it can be done.</p>

        <p>Á: <span class="tengwar">Á</span>. Illustrates the use of wilya to represent a double-A, in place of a long-carrier.</p>

        <p>Atto: <span class="tengwar">Atto</span>. The double-T should be represented by "tinco" with a tilde below.</p>

        <p>Yuldar: <span class="tengwar">Yuldar</span>. The initial Y is a special double-dot-above diacritic.  Long I is on a long carrier.</p>

        <p>Írensaga: <span class="tengwar">Írensaga</span>. Not a Sindarin word, but rather “iron saw” in archaic English.  The long I is on a long carrier.</p>

        <p>Sinome maruvan: <span class="tengwar">Sinome maruvan</span>. Quenya, not appropriate for this mode.</p>

        <p>Allys: <span class="tengwar">Allys</span>. Not elvish. Lots of potential mis-interactions between the double-L, the Y-diacritic, and following-S.</p>

        <p>Hobbits'': <span class="tengwar">Hobbits''</span>. Illustrates the use of a straight apostrophe to use alternate S-hooks.</p>

        <p>XX ksks tsts IQS: <span class="tengwar">XX ksks tsts IQS</span>. Some problematic tehta and S-hook combinations. T-S-hook must only be final. K-S-hook can be medial.  ICWS cluster must not place S-hook on C.</p>
