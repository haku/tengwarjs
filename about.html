        <p><em><strong>Usage:</strong></em>
        <a href=".">This</a> is a live transcriber from our Latin phonetic
        alphabet to the elvish Tengwar alphabet.  Type a message in the bottom
        text area and it will be displayed in the equivalent elvish letters
        in the area above.  Copy the link in the address bar and send
        your message to friends and colleagues.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Compatibility:</strong></em> The transcriber may not
        work in some browsers because I used fancy early-draft features of some
        other web browsers. I might go through the motions to make it work in
        legacy browsers some day, but this would be an expensive and
        unsatisfying project.</p>

        <p>However, there is a much older
        <a href="http://tengwar.art.pl/tengwar/ott/start.php?l=en">tengwar transcriber</a>
        that should suffice in the interim.</p>
        
        <p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong></em> The transcriber is suitable for showing
        how the <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindarin">Sindarin</a>
        language might have been written and attempts to be consistent with
        <em>The King’s Letter</em> from J.R.R.&nbsp;Tolkien’s book,
        <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sauron_Defeated">Sauron&nbsp;Defeated</a>,
        commonly called the
        “<a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general.htm">General&nbsp;Use</a>”
        mode. I used the same mode for my
        <a href="http://3rin.gs/"><nobr>Map of Middle-earth</nobr></a>.</p>

        <p>I’ve posted some <a href="samples.html">sample transcriptions</a>
        of Sindarin.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Technical details:</strong></em> The font used is a derrivative of Johan Winge’s
        <a href="http://home.student.uu.se/jowi4905/fonts/annatar.html">Tengwar Annatar</a>
        italic and italic alternate characters.  The italic font is designed to
        resemble the <em>Ring Enscription</em> from <em>The Lord of the
        Rings</em>, presumably in Sauron’s own cursive.</p>

        <p>The font uses an “encoding” established by
        <a href="http://www.acondia.com/fonts/tengwar/index.html">Dan Smith</a>
        wherein letters on an English qwerty keyboard are arranged to correspond
        with the Tengwar grid transposed on its side.
        Because there are not enough characters accessible on an the keyboard
        to represent all of the glyphs and alternate glyphs of the Tengwar
        alphabet, Johan’s Annatar provides some glyphs in an alternate font.</p>

        <p>Because of limitations in rendering text on the web and the
        peculiarities of elvish fonts, it was not possible to alternate between
        the normal and alternate fonts in this application.  Instead, I’ve
        created a custom version of the font that incorporates the alternate
        glyphs I needed for this mode using code points that are not so
        accessible on the keyboard, particularly for doubled long-O and long-U
        diacritics, the paired curls forward and backward, and also some
        rotated U-hook tehtar that were less prone to overlap with the
        underlying tengwar.</p>

        <p>The particular limitation is that diacritics in elvish have no width
        and are drawn before the cursor. Some of the diacritics I use are in
        the alternate font.  To put an alternate diacritic over the previous
        tengwa, consonant, glyph, you have to put it in a
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag with the alternate font face, but as a
        result, the bounding box for the character has zero-width.  I could not
        find a way to render the text outside the bounding box of the tag.</p>

        <p>This transcriber does not require the character encoding to use code
        points that are accessible on a qwerty keyboard, so it might be worthwhile to create a new font
        that seizes a neglected pane of Unicode and uses ligatures and kerning
        instead of zero-width diacritics.  The difficulty is that every
        combination and cluster of diacritics would need to have a unique
        and customized code-point, anchoring diacritics precisely where they
        need to be or providing ligatures for difficult placements.</p>

        <p>In the interim, I’ve engaged in the process of manually verifying
        the placement and use of diacritics for every
        <a href="combinations.html">combination</a> of tengwa and tehta.</p>

        <p>If you take a look under the hood, the transcriber is a CommonJS
        module and a jQuery plugin.</p>

        <p>Further work might include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>More modes of transcription, particularly phonetic and
            orthographic English and Quenya.</li>
            <li>Tie-in with IPA dictionaries of various languages</li>
            <li>Tie-in with elvish dictionary for special-cases</li>
            <li>Display intermediate encoding that shows the names of each
            tengwa and tehta in every cluster.</li>
            <li>Search the dictionary, encyclopedia, and map.</li>
        </ul>
